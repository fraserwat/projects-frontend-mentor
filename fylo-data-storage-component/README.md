## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- CSSS Keyframe Animations

### What I learned

Learnt lots of new stuff on this one.

- Keyframe animations
- Pseudoelements
- Text gradients

Probably could have executed it cleaner, but it's a good learning for next time.

### Continued development

Work on getting a better intuition with pseudoelements.

Get the hang of absolute and relative positioning.
