## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- Vue.js

### What I learned

This was my first Vue app! Quite simple, would be good to do more complex stuff next.

### Continued development

Want to start using Vue for more stuff going forward, so a lot of the difficulty and looking things up should ease up once I get used to using the markup.
