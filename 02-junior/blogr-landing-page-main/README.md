## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

Two areas I think I learnt a lot from here:

- The menu (with inner and outer menus) was tricky to get both the CSS and Javascript for - this was a good learning experience!!
- Got some nice fluid typography and margin sizes with `clamp()`. Not 100% perfect this, but I think a lot of that is just practice.

### Continued development

Next step from here will be getting more practice with the `clamp()` attribute.
