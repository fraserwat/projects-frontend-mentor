### What I learned

Thought I'd struggle with the `::after` pseduoelement on the menu a lot more than I did, which was nice.

Lots of the difficulty around this was around the image sizings, especially around the "Graphic Design" and "Photography" headers. Still not 100% happy with how they turned out...

### Continued development

Going to take on a project with loads of images next, try and get my head around that.
