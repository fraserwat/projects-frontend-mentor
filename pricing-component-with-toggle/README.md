## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- Vanilla JavaScript

### What I learned

Few tricky bits with this.

Was pleased with the currency converter I put together with a conversion API. I think I'm starting to get the hang of API calls. Not quite there yet though.

### Continued development

More API stuff would be useful to do.
