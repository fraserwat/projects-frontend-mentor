## My process

### Built with

- HTML5
- CSS
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- Javascript

### What I learned

Extending this project to include a functional chat function was a pretty big challenge, involved a lot of stuff around the `position` attribute (absolute vs relative) that I'd used before but didn't really understand until now.

This was also useful in positioning the pseduoelements for the background.

### Continued development

Further practice with the relative vs absolute positioning would be useful to cement this.

### Useful resources

- [Positioning - W3Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/css/css_positioning.asp) - The explanations of relative vs absolute positioning here helped a lot with getting the chat window to scroll up.
