## Overview

### Screenshot

![](./screenshot.jpg)

Add a screenshot of your solution. The easiest way to do this is to use Firefox to view your project, right-click the page and select "Take a Screenshot". You can choose either a full-height screenshot or a cropped one based on how long the page is. If it's very long, it might be best to crop it.

Alternatively, you can use a tool like [FireShot](https://getfireshot.com/) to take the screenshot. FireShot has a free option, so you don't need to purchase it.

Then crop/optimize/edit your image however you like, add it to your project, and update the file path in the image above.

**Note: Delete this note and the paragraphs above when you add your screenshot. If you prefer not to add a screenshot, feel free to remove this entire section.**

## My process

### Built with

- HTML5
- CSS
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- Javascript

### What I learned

Extending this project to include a functional chat function was a pretty big challenge, involved a lot of stuff around the `position` attribute (absolute vs relative) that I'd used before but didn't really understand until now.

This was also useful in positioning the pseduoelements for the background.

### Continued development

Further practice with the relative vs absolute positioning would be useful to cement this.

### Useful resources

- [Positioning - W3Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/css/css_positioning.asp) - The explanations of relative vs absolute positioning here helped a lot with getting the chat window to scroll up.
