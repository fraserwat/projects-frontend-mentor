## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- Javascript

### What I learned

Had quite a bit of trouble with this one, was the `position` and `overflow` attributes on the desktop popup and its parent divs that really threw me. Ended up leaving it for a while, and coming back when I'd learnt a bit more about this stuff from a different challenge. As a result a lot of the code isn't as clean as I'd write it now.
